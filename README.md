When creating the application, the following pods were used:

- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for requesting data from the network
- [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) for to make a layout, instead of using a storyboard
- [Gloss](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss) for decoding JSON
